# üîç How to Find Public/Private Setting in Backblaze B2

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Access Your Bucket Settings
1. Go to [Backblaze B2 Console](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm)
2. Click on your bucket name: `freeload-uploads`
3. You should see a page with bucket details

### 2. Look for "Bucket Settings" Section
The public/private setting is usually in one of these locations:

**Option A: Bucket Settings Tab**
- Look for a "Bucket Settings" button or tab
- Click on it to access advanced settings

**Option B: Files and Folders Tab**
- Sometimes it's under "Files and Folders" ‚Üí "Bucket Settings"

**Option C: Main Bucket Page**
- Look for "Bucket Type" or "Bucket Privacy" on the main bucket page
- It might show "Public" or "Private" next to your bucket name

### 3. What to Look For
You're looking for one of these settings:
- **Bucket Type**: Public vs Private
- **Bucket Privacy**: Public vs Private  
- **File Access**: Public vs Private
- **Bucket Visibility**: Public vs Private

### 4. If You Can't Find It
Try these locations:
1. **Bucket Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy Settings**
2. **Bucket Settings** ‚Üí **Access Control**
3. **Bucket Settings** ‚Üí **Permissions**
4. Look for a gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è or settings icon next to your bucket name

### 5. Alternative Method: Check Bucket Info
From your bucket info, I can see:
```
Type: Public
```

This confirms your bucket is currently public. Look for this "Type" field and change it to "Private".

### 6. If Still Can't Find It
1. Try the B2 command line tool:
   ```bash
   b2 get-bucket freeload-uploads
   ```
2. Or contact Backblaze support - they can help you locate the setting

### 7. What It Should Look Like When Fixed
After changing to private, you should see:
```
Type: Private
```

## üö® Why This Matters
- **Public buckets** = Anyone can access your files directly
- **Private buckets** = Only authorized applications can access files
- Your app will still work with private buckets (it uses API keys)

## ‚úÖ After Making It Private
1. The bucket type should show "Private"
2. Your files will be secure
3. The app will still work normally (it uses API authentication)
4. Railway deployment should proceed successfully
