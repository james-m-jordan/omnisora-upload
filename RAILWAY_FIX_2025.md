# 🚀 Railway Deployment Fix - January 2025

## 🎯 What I Fixed

1. **Created `nixpacks.toml`** - Proper build configuration for Railway
2. **Updated `Procfile`** - Added PORT binding and timeout settings
3. **Created `railway.toml`** - Railway-specific deployment settings
4. **Frontend Build** - Configured to build React app and copy to static folder

## 📋 Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
cd /Users/jimjordan/omnifreeload/omnisora-upload-repo
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment with proper nixpacks configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Settings

In your Railway project:

1. **Environment Variables** (already set from screenshots):
   - `B2_KEY_ID`
   - `B2_APPLICATION_KEY`
   - `B2_BUCKET`
   - `B2_ENDPOINT`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional for now)

2. **Deploy Settings**:
   - Builder: Nixpacks (will auto-detect)
   - Start Command: (will use Procfile)
   - Health Check Path: `/health`

### 3. What Happens During Deploy

1. Railway detects `nixpacks.toml`
2. Installs Python 3.11 and Node.js 18
3. Installs Python dependencies
4. Builds frontend with Vite
5. Copies frontend files to static folder
6. Starts Gunicorn with app_simple.py

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If deployment fails, check:

1. **Build Logs**: Look for npm or pip errors
2. **Deploy Logs**: Check if Gunicorn starts
3. **Runtime Logs**: Look for B2 connection errors

## 🎉 Expected Result

- App deploys successfully
- Health check passes at `/health`
- File upload works with B2 storage
- Frontend loads at root URL

## 🚨 If Still Failing

Try this alternative approach:

1. Remove `nixpacks.toml` and `railway.toml`
2. Create `setup.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
mkdir -p static && cp -r frontend/dist/* static/
```

3. Update Procfile:
```
web: bash setup.sh && gunicorn app_simple:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

This approach runs setup during startup instead of build phase.
