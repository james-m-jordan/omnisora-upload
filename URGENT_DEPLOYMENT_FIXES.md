# üö® URGENT: Deployment Fixes Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE: Your B2 Bucket is PUBLIC!

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Go to [Backblaze B2 Console](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm)
2. Click on `freeload-uploads` bucket
3. Change from "Public" to "Private" 
4. Save the changes

This is critical for security - public buckets expose all your files to the internet!

## üîß Railway Environment Variables

Add these variables in Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab:

```
B2_KEY_ID=005381ec3765c1f0000000002
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=K005w5wHDxxoGPN5s845FBmdeGQ9xhw
B2_BUCKET=freeload-uploads
B2_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key-here>
```

**Note**: Use your actual OpenAI API key that starts with `sk-proj-`

## üìù CORS Settings for B2

After making the bucket private, update CORS:
1. Select "Share everything in this bucket with all HTTPS origins"
2. Apply CORS rules to: "S3 Compatible API"
3. Save changes

## üöÄ Railway Deployment Steps

1. First, ensure the environment variables are set in Railway
2. The deployment should automatically restart
3. Check the deploy logs for any errors

## ‚úÖ What This Fixes

- Removed conflicting railway.json
- Simplified build process with nixpacks.toml
- Added proper error handling and timeouts
- Fixed security issue with public bucket
- Proper environment variable configuration

## üîç If Deployment Still Fails

Check Railway deploy logs and look for:
- Missing dependencies
- Build errors in frontend
- Python package installation issues

The app should be working within 5 minutes after these changes!
