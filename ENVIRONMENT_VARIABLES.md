# Environment Variables Configuration

## Required Variables for Railway Deployment

### Backblaze B2 Storage
```
B2_KEY_ID=your_b2_key_id_here
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your_b2_application_key_here
B2_BUCKET=freeload-uploads
B2_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com
```

### OpenAI API (for AI tagging features)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... (your OpenAI API key)
```

### Optional Variables
```
PORT=5000  # Railway sets this automatically
```

## Setting Variables in Railway

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Railway will automatically redeploy when variables are added

## Important Notes

- The B2_BUCKET should match your Backblaze bucket name
- The B2_ENDPOINT format is: https://s3.{region}.backblazeb2.com
- Without OPENAI_API_KEY, AI tagging will be disabled but uploads will still work
- Ensure your B2 bucket is set to private (public URLs are generated by the app)
