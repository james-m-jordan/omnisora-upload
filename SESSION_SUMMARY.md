# ðŸ“Š OmniLoad Development Session Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Accomplished

### Sprint 1: Basic Upload (Previously Completed)
- âœ… Flask app with B2 integration
- âœ… File upload with SHA256 hashing
- âœ… SQLite metadata storage
- âœ… Deployed to Railway
- âœ… Fixed B2 URL construction (f005 not f5)

### Sprint 2: Hash-Based Retrieval (This Session)
- âœ… Hash-based file access at `/f/<hash_prefix>`
- âœ… Beautiful file info pages with metadata
- âœ… Search functionality by filename or hash
- âœ… Download tracking and counters
- âœ… Enhanced UI with drag-and-drop
- âœ… Database migrations for backward compatibility
- âœ… Human-readable file sizes
- âœ… Disambiguation for hash collisions

### Documentation Created
- âœ… Comprehensive README with features and deployment guide
- âœ… DEVELOPMENT.md with technical details
- âœ… CONTEXT.md for AI handoff
- âœ… Updated .gitignore

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Stats

- **Total Development Time**: ~90 minutes (Sprint 1 + Sprint 2)
- **Lines of Code**: ~700 (all in app.py)
- **Features Shipped**: 10+
- **Deployment Status**: Live on Railway
- **Database Schema**: 10 columns with auto-migration

## ðŸ”‘ Key Technical Decisions

1. **Monolithic app.py**: Everything in one file for rapid iteration
2. **Inline Templates**: No separate template files, easier to deploy
3. **SQLite**: Zero-config database perfect for this use case
4. **Automatic Migrations**: Database updates itself on startup
5. **Private B2 Bucket**: More secure than public bucket

## ðŸš€ Ready for Next Session

The project is fully documented and ready for:
- Sprint 3: Enhanced UI & CORS
- Sprint 4: Security features
- Sprint 5: Scale and polish

All code is committed, pushed, and deployed. The next developer (human or AI) has everything they need in CONTEXT.md to continue development.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

1. **Ship First, Perfect Later**: We went from zero to production in 90 minutes
2. **Documentation Matters**: Spent time creating comprehensive docs for handoff
3. **Simple Architecture Wins**: One file, inline templates, SQLite = fast development
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Each sprint builds on real usage patterns
