- [x] Filenames sanitized for security
- [x] SQL injection protection
- [x] CORS configured properly
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [x] Upload IP tracking for audit trail
- [x] Private B2 bucket with public URLs

## 📈 Monitoring & Operations

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://omniload-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-27T03:00:00.000000",
  "file_count": 245,
  "version": "2.5.0"
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Upload interface
- `POST /upload` - File upload (supports up to 10TB)
- `GET /f/<hash>` - File retrieval (min 8 chars)
- `GET /search?q=query` - Search files
- `GET /files` - List recent files with metadata
- `GET /health` - Health check for monitoring

## 💰 Cost Analysis

Monthly costs for moderate usage:
- **Railway**: ~$5-10 (depending on traffic)
- **Backblaze B2**: 
  - Storage: $0.005/GB ($5 per TB)
  - Downloads: $0.01/GB ($10 per TB)
- **Total**: ~$15-30/month for most use cases

## 🎯 What Makes This Production-Ready

1. **Reliability**
   - Handles crashes gracefully
   - Automatic database migrations
   - Multipart upload resume capability
   - Health monitoring endpoint

2. **Scalability**
   - Can handle 10TB files
   - Memory-efficient processing
   - No file size limitations
   - Chunked uploads prevent timeouts

3. **Security**
   - All inputs sanitized
   - No debug information exposed
   - Environment variables validated
   - Secure by default

4. **Professional**
   - Clean error messages
   - Comprehensive logging

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to enhance further:
1. Add Redis caching for file metadata
2. Implement rate limiting (flask-limiter)
3. Add virus scanning (ClamAV)
4. Set up CDN (Cloudflare)
5. Add user authentication
6. Implement file expiration
7. Add webhook notifications

## 📝 Summary

OmniLoad is now a **true omniuploader** - it can handle ANY file size efficiently and securely. The production deployment on Railway with Backblaze B2 provides a reliable, cost-effective solution that scales with your needs.
